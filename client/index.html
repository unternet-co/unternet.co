    <h1>Operator</h1>
    <h2>Think and do with an agent that's yours.</h2>
    <ul class="features">
        <li><strong>Direct manipulation:</strong> Chat is cumbersome. Agents should be quick. Operator gives you the best of both: mini apps for fast interactions, and a chat thread for everything else.</li>
        <li><strong>Workspace-based:</strong> We know there's a lot happening in your life. Organize different workspaces with access to different resources, to help keep both you and your agent focused.</li>
        <li><strong>Open & customizable:</strong> Missing something? It's infinitely extensible. Add the data and behaviours you need via the <a href="/docs/web-applets/introduction">web applets</a> protocol.</li>
        <li><strong>Local & private:</strong> Operator is your own. No one else controls your agent. You can connect it to a cloud-based model if you want, but by default it will run locally through Ollama.</li>
