# Open Source Engineer (Remote, or San Francisco)

This role is available full-time and contract.

## About the company

Unternet is a brand new startup building the future fabric of the web. We’re backed by Betaworks & Mozilla Ventures, and will soon be completing our pre-seed raise of $3-5M. Our goal is to build the successor to the browser, an intelligent web-based operating system that can coordinate information and apps to help humans get things done & live better digital lives.

A big part of that is working with the community to ensure the future of software stays open. Our first launch is the open-source [Web Applets](https://github.com/unternet-co/web-applets/) protocol & SDK, which allows anyone to build AI-native apps that are compatible with any client that implements the protocol.

## About the role

As an Open Source Engineer, you’ll be responsible for…

- **Building.** You’ll be working on Unternet’s key open-source developer offerings, such as Web Applets, and potentially creating new libraries and tools as needed to support Unternet’s mission.
- **Community engagement.** Responding to bug fixes & issues, stewarding our Discord, mailing list, and other gathering places, putting on community events, and helping teams implement our tools. Also, understanding how they’re being used and points of improvement.
- **Growing our network.** You’ll be responsible for helping to maintain and grow the team’s network and relationships with open source AI & web developers. This will include advocating for Web Applets.
- **Creating technical content.** You’ll create the technical content & documentation that helps developers understand how to use Unternet’s dev tooling, and gives them clear ways to get involved.

Everyone is different, and we recognize that backgrounds and skill sets that suit this role will vary. Here's our best guess at the profile of someone who will be successful in this role:

- You have experience contributing to open-source projects & managing developer communities
- You're a programmer with 5-10 years' experience
- You have strong JavaScript & TypeScript skills
- Ability to work independently and remotely
- You're excited by the work we're doing, and align with our values!

## Compensation

US$70,000 – US$160,000

We will work together to decide on the (competitive!) market rate for your region & circumstances.
