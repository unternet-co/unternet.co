# Lead Designer

## About the company

Unternet is a brand new startup building the future fabric of the web. We’re backed by Betaworks & Mozilla Ventures, and will soon be completing our pre-seed raise of $3-5M. Our goal is to build the successor to the browser, an intelligent web-based operating system that can coordinate information and apps to help humans get things done & live better digital lives.

Our first launch is the open-source [Web Applets](https://github.com/unternet-co/web-applets/) protocol & SDK, which allows anyone to build AI-native apps that are compatible with any client that implements the protocol.

This is a greenfield era for interface design, and we believe design will be our most important differentiator. Of particular importance will be finding the right metaphors to communicate novel interactions clearly to users. The designs you create with Unternet have the potential to set the tone for the future of human-computer interfaces for decades to come!
