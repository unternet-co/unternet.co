# Lead Designer

## About the company

Unternet is a brand new startup building the future fabric of the web. We’re backed by Betaworks & Mozilla Ventures, and will soon be completing our pre-seed raise of $3-5M. Our goal is to build the successor to the browser, an intelligent web-based operating system that can coordinate information and apps to help humans get things done & live better digital lives.

A big part of that is working with the community to ensure the future of software stays open. Our first launch is the open-source [Web Applets](https://github.com/unternet-co/web-applets/) protocol & SDK, which allows anyone to build AI-native apps that are compatible with any client that implements the protocol.

As we build this next generation platform, we need exceptional engineering leadership to establish our technical foundation and guide our implementation choices. The technology decisions you make at Unternet have the potential to influence how web applications are built for years to come.
