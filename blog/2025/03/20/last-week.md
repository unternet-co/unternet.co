title: 'Last week at Unternet: Build systems, a new look & ATmosphere'
---

With **Web Applets 0.2** out in the world _(if you haven't seen it yet, [check out our demo](https://bsky.app/profile/ruperts.world/post/3lk7byru5y22z)!)_, our attention is focused solely on getting an early copy of our client into your hands. Recently, I heard this described as _"ChatGPT but with apps"_, or as our designer Ryan simply puts it: _"it has hands"_.

So, this week has been all about some of the finer points of product development as we prepare for release: cross-platform build systems, auto-updates, data caching... Oh! And local models — our client is now compatible with **Ollama**, meaning it will work on an airplane, underwater, and in space (or simply when you're off the grid).

We've got a new look! While we've been working away on the client, Ryan has put together a brand that reflects our love for the open web. In his words:

> The web is built on defaults—colors, structures, and protocols that we barely notice but rely upon every day.
>
> The Unternet wordmark now breaks into its core syllables: un · ter · net—a nod to the rhythm of our speech, the tokens shaping AI interactions, and the composable and extensible nature of information itself. Our refreshed action blue (#0000FF) and reaction purple (#8207D7) accent colors expose the raw functional defaults of the links we click to navigate the web. And a variety of map projections remind us there's never just one way to understand this world.
>
> At its root, “un” remains. We're here to untangle complexities, unburden users, and unlock a more open, resilient, and locally-driven approach to managing information.

## ATmosphere conference

This weekend I'll be in Seattle (along with a few members of the Unternet greater disapora) to attend the inaugural [ATmosphere conference](https://atprotocol.dev/atmosphereconf/). I'm quietly excited about AT protocol's potential to usher in an open data & identity layer that the internet has been sorely missing.

Looking forward to connecting with the community and sharing some demos! Get in touch if you're going to be there.
