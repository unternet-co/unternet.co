title: 'Hello, Telepath'

Today, I'm excited to share that Unternet is joining forces with [Telepath](https://telepath.computer/), as I re-unite with my former Mozilla colleagues [Stephen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/stlhood) and [Josh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/yetanotherjosh/) as co-founders to build something truly new.

## My year of Unternet

Over the past year, Unternet has been my laboratory for exploring how AI can transform the relationship between users and their software. As a solo founder (albeit with some great contractors that helped me along the way) I've been deep in R&D on a core question: what if the browser—our "user agent"—actually acted as a true _agent_ on your behalf? How would our experience of the web be different, if it was mediated by AI?

This research phase taught me what's possible, what's hard, and where the real leverage points lie. But I’ve realized that to truly reimagine how humans interact with computers, we need to go well beyond the browser layer and rethink the personal computing experience from first principles. And this is a much larger job than I can tackle by myself.

## My new co-founders

Back when I was at Mozilla, I had a collaboration with Stephen and Josh that stands out as the best of my career. We challenged each other, built on each other's ideas, and importantly, moved with an incredible velocity. I've wanted to work with them again ever since.

A few months ago, Stephen reached out. He was leaving Mozilla to start a new company called Telepath. His vision of a new personal computing paradigm enabled by AI aligned remarkably with what I'd been uncovering at Unternet.

Over the following months, it became clear that what we each understood independently would become something more powerful in combination. I’m pleased to announce that Josh, Stephen and I have since officially joined together as co-founders.

## What’s next

As Telepath, we're now a team uniquely equipped to turn ambitious research into reality.

Stephen and Josh are both serial entrepreneurs with successful exits behind them. Stephen, now CEO, led major open source AI projects at Mozilla and brings deep experience in turning new technologies into real world products. Josh, now CTO, has been pioneering new approaches to agentic code generation. As Chief Design Officer, I'm focused on reimagining how humans interact with this new computing paradigm.

Ensuring the next computing platform remains open is as important as ever. We're still deciding the best home for Unternet's community & open-source work around this, exploring how it might become part of a broader effort with like-minded collaborators.

I hope you'll follow along for this next phase of the journey. If you’re not already on the Unternet mailing list, you can sign up for updates about Telepath [here](https://buttondown.com/telepath) – we'll have exciting stuff to share very soon.
