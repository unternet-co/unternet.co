title: 'Web Applets @ Causal Islands Berlin'
---

We've been in the thick of some protocol improvements ([RFC here](https://github.com/unternet-co/web-applets/issues/41)) and preparing our client for a developer preview launch this past week, and making good progress. More on that in our next update.

But for now, I'd like to share a video from [Causal Islands Berlin](https://berlin.causalislands.com/) which was just published (thanks [Boris](https://bmannconsulting.com/)!), where I talk about user agency, why it's important, the Web Applets protocol, and how we can make new, empowering types of software.

Embed below, or you can watch it [here on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wK_n7yhzfLw).
